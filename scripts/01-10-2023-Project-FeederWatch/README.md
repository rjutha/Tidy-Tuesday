## Description 
This was my first visualization for Tidy Tuesday.
In this project I filtered a dataset to visualize the most common birds in British Columbia.
Something new I tried with this plot was using the package ggimage to add pictures of the birds from google.
I used GIMP, a software similar to photoshop to circle crop the images.
I also practiced using custom google fonts in Rstudio.
As an improvement I would have used better more zoomed out photos of the birds since that makes it easier to display them.
