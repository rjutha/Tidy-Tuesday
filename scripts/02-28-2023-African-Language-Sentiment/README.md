## Description 
For this tidy tuesday I decided to make a simple plot and try using the package ggtext.
For this plot I used it to use html syntax to format text for titles, subtiles, etc.
Using HTML syntax allows for greater control of the text formatting, such as font size, color, and alignment. This makes it easier to present text in a way that is visually appealing and easy to read.
I also used the ggsci package which is an R package that provides scientific-style colour palettes and colour scales for data analysis.
