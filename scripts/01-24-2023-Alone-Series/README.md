## Description 
This was my third visualization for Tidy Tuesday.
For this project I tried many new things which was exciting.
Since there were 4 different pieces of information provided in this data set I tried to create 4 different plots and combine them using the package patchwork.
In this plot I experiented with custom axis labels as well as using different types of plots than I normally do.
Specific new plots were the count plot using individual bars, a dumbell plot to communicate the average ratings, and a bump plot to visualize the top items each season.
